# Neural-Machine-Translation

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. In this notebook, we will build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates (&quot;25th of June, 2009&quot;) into machine-readable dates (&quot;2009-06-25&quot;). We will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models.
